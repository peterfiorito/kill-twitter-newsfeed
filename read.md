# Kill Twitter NewsFeed
## A tool to overcome twitter addiction

There is a miriad of different strategies out there aimed to overcome social media addiction.
Most of them go along the lines of: time your use of them, use a time limiting extension, use a pomodoro timer, etc etc.

Most of these techniques, although they are valid as a starting point, they fail to address the root issue: social media and our browsing habits create a heavy dependency that conditions our brain to visit the site everytime we are bored, even if there is nothing there to see. Even with time limiters, we always seem to spend more time than what we would like to in this sites.

The solution, or at least what I think is a better approach, is to understand that for you to turn down the stimulus intensity, you need TW to become BORING. You will still go in, but you wont spend more than a minute there, as it's BORING.

This chrome extension is a work in progress, but right now it does the trick: when the url matches twitter, it will try to find the news feed and kill (erase) it.

With this simple technique I went from a 20 min a day use to aprox 5 minutes.

This was inspired in the Kill-facebook chrome extension, which has work very nicely in eliminating for me any attractive that facebook used to have.

I will continue to update the extension piece by piece and add more features (I am working on the activate/deactivate pop up as a backup and some additional options). For now, is simple but it does the job.
